        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>       
            As a team, we implemented a website showcasing pet 
            photos. We extracted information about the pet photos 
            from the Unsplash dataset (Lite Version) to construct 
            our website. The information we extracted consists of 
            the metadata and captions of the pet photos. We used 
            Static Site Generator to create the HTML for the site 
            instead of managing 100 photos by hand. </p>
            
            <p>Eleventy was used
            to turn the data in the directory into a site with one 
            webpage for each photo. This meant that each photo had
            its own individual page. From each HTML file, the 
            front-matter data was used along with Eleventy templates.
            The templates were used to create enhanced pages for 
            each picture plus credit and additional information for each 
            photo. We had to validate our markup and enhance the site-wide 
            layout so the site would include the standard page elements. 
            We then added an additional feature which allows the user to go
            to the previous and next picture. </p> 
            
            <p>
            In order to create the previous, current, and next page, we 
            had to get the number part of the url. The number was converted 
            into a string number to integer. Then we only rendered the 
            pageable tab when the current page was not the first or last 
            page. If the number page is greater than zero and less than nine, 
            then 00 is added to the previous and next value before converting 
            back to a string. If the number page is 9, 00 is added to the previous 
            and next value. If the number page is 10, 00 is added to the previous 
            and next value. Lastly, if the number page is greater than 10, 0 is 
            added to front before converting back to a string. The pageable tab 
            is rendered one more time for page 0 and page 99. Page 0 doesn’t have 
            a previous and page 99 doesn’t have a next. Therefore, we reload the 
            the either page 0 or 99 if the user clicks previous/next.
    
            Lastly, this project could have not been completed 
            without the
