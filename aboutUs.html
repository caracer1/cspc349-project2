    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>

        
        As a team, we implemented a website showcasing pet 
        photos. We extracted information about the pet photos 
        from the Unsplash dataset (Lite Version) to construct 
        our website. The information we extracted consists of 
        the metadata and captions of the pet photos. We used 
        Static Site Generator to create the HTML for the site 
        instead of managing 100 photos by hand. </p>
        
        <p>Eleventy was used
        to turn the data in the directory into a site with one 
        webpage for each photo. This meant that each photo had
        its own individual page. From each HTML file, the 
        front-matter data was used along with Eleventy templates.
        The templates were used to create enhanced pages  for 
        each picture plus credit and additional information for each 
        photo. We had to validate our markup and enhance the site-wide 
        layout so the site would include the standard page elements. 
        We added an additional feature which avoided repeating the list of 
        100 pictures. Lastly, this project could have not been completed 
        without the
